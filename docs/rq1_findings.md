## Executive Summary

This document presents findings from RQ1 experiments comparing the **Thinking model** (extended reasoning mode) against the **Baseline model** (standard instruction-following) for vulnerability detection, using both zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies.

**Key Research Question**: Does enabling extended reasoning mode (thinking) in LLMs improve vulnerability detection performance, and what is the energy cost?

**Zero-shot vs Few-shot**:
- Baseline: Few-shot has higher precision (62.50% vs 50.91%) but lower recall (5.18% vs 14.51%)
- Thinking: Zero-shot performs better overall (F1: 39.19% vs 27.13%)

**Best Performing Configuration**: Thinking Zero-shot (F1: 39.19%, Recall: 30.05%)

### 1.3 Error Analysis

**Thinking Zero-shot** had one problematic sample:
- **Sample 344242** (lua/CVE-2022-33099): Consistently stuck or took 5-14+ minutes

- Hypothesis: Recursive error-handling code triggers problematic reasoning loops
- Decision: Marked as "skipped" and documented as known limitation

All other experiments completed successfully with 100% sample coverage.

## 2. Energy Consumption Analysis

### 2.1 Data Sources and Validation

We track energy consumption using two complementary data sources:

#### Source 1: Custom Energy Tracking (`energy_tracking.json`)
- **Purpose**: Aggregated summary across experiment sessions
- **Collection Method**:
  - Each experiment run is a "session" (tracking continues across resume)
  - CodeCarbon's `OfflineEmissionsTracker` runs during inference
  - At session end, we call `tracker.stop()` which returns session emissions (kg CO2)
  - We accumulate: `total_emissions += session_emissions`
  - Stored in: `{exp_name}_energy_tracking.json`

**Code Implementation** (src/single_agent_vuln.py:477-495):
```python
# Start tracker
tracker = OfflineEmissionsTracker(
    project_name=f"{exp_name}_session_{energy_data['sessions'] + 1}",
    output_dir=codecarbon_dir,
    country_iso_code="CAN",
    save_to_file=True
)
tracker.start()

# ... run inference ...

# Stop and accumulate
session_emissions = tracker.stop()
energy_data['total_emissions'] += session_emissions  # Accumulate across sessions
energy_data['sessions'] += 1
energy_data['session_history'].append({
    'session': energy_data['sessions'],
    'start_time': session_start_time,
    'end_time': session_end_time,
    'samples_processed': len(remaining_samples),
    'session_emissions': session_emissions
})
```

**Example** (Baseline Few-shot):
```json
{
  "total_emissions": 0.11340119693900293,  // Sum of all sessions
  "sessions": 3,
  "session_history": [
    {"session": 1, "session_emissions": 0.0398588796394388},
    {"session": 2, "session_emissions": 0.07354163139247068},
    {"session": 3, "session_emissions": 6.859070934391303e-07}
  ]
}
```

#### Source 2: CodeCarbon Emissions CSV (`emissions.csv`)
- **Purpose**: Detailed hardware-level metrics per session
- **Collection Method**:
  - CodeCarbon automatically appends one row per session to `emissions.csv`
  - Each row contains: timestamp, duration, emissions, cpu_power, gpu_power, ram_power, cpu_energy, gpu_energy, ram_energy, etc.
  - Stored in: `codecarbon_{reasoning_mode}_{design}/emissions.csv`

**Example** (from emissions.csv:src/single_agent_vuln.py):
```csv
timestamp,duration,emissions,cpu_power,gpu_power,ram_power,cpu_energy,gpu_energy,ram_energy
2025-10-11T10:55:48,1592.608,0.0398588796,112.5,229.2,188.8,0.0497,0.1011,0.0835
2025-10-11T11:51:57,2937.802,0.0735416314,112.5,229.0,188.8,0.0918,0.1866,0.1540
2025-10-11T16:51:41,0.047,6.859e-07,112.5,12.1,188.8,1.47e-06,1.55e-07,2.41e-06
```

#### Cross-Validation
We validate data consistency by comparing:
- `energy_tracking.json`: `total_emissions` (sum of all sessions)
- `emissions.csv`: Sum of `emissions` column across all rows

**Expected Result**: < 0.01% difference (near-perfect match)

*See `notebooks/rq1_codecarbon_analysis.ipynb` for detailed validation results*

   - **Benefit**: 2.1x higher F1 score (17.08 percentage points improvement)
   - **Efficiency**: ~0.26 kWh per percentage point F1 improvement
   - **Verdict**: Tradeoff may be justified for high-stakes vulnerability detection where recall matters

2. **Deployment considerations**:
   - Thinking mode adds significant inference cost:
     - Energy: +0.00237 kg CO2 per sample
     - Time: 4.4x longer execution (6.5 hours vs 1.5 hours average)
     - Cost estimate: ~$0.45 per 1000 samples additional (at $0.10/kWh)
   - Best for: Critical security applications where missing vulnerabilities (FN) is costly

3. **Environmental impact**:
   - For 1 million samples: +2.37 metric tons CO2 for thinking mode
   - Equivalent to: ~5,900 miles driven by average car
   - Recommendation: Use selectively, not as default for all code scanning

4. **Use case recommendations**:
   - **Use Thinking mode**: High-value targets, security-critical code, zero-day detection
   - **Use Baseline mode**: Routine scans, CI/CD pipelines, large-scale screening
   - **Best configuration**: Thinking Zero-shot (highest F1, best recall)
   - **Avoid**: Few-shot prompting (no performance benefit, wastes energy)

## 6. Limitations and Future Work

### 6.1 Known Limitations
1. **Sample 344242**: Thinking model cannot process recursive error-handling code (marked as skipped)
2. **Dataset size**: 384 samples may not capture full vulnerability diversity
3. **Single hardware setup**: Results specific to RTX A5000 GPU
4. **Language detection**: Heuristic-based, may misclassify edge cases

### 6.2 Future Work
1. **Larger dataset**: Expand to 1000+ samples for statistical significance
2. **Multi-GPU comparison**: Test on different hardware (A100, H100, etc.)
3. **Reasoning depth analysis**: Does longer thinking time correlate with accuracy?
4. **Cost-benefit optimization**: Can we selectively use thinking mode for complex samples only?
